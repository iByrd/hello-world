## About me
Hi! I am currently finishing my BS in Information Technology with a focus of Software Development. Through my experience so far, I also have realized that I enjoy working with databases and data. I previously worked a job in sales for 12 years, but am happy that I went back to school to get into the field I always wanted to work in!
